# Visual Studio build notes

## Pre-requisites

- Install Visual Studio 2019
- Install latest CMake (3.14.5, at time of writing)
- Clone pcg-cpp into 3rdparty dir
- Extract TBB into "\Program Files\Intel\TBB", and update PATH to include "C:\Program Files\Intel\TBB\bin\intel64\vc14"
- Clone https://github.com/justusc/FindTBB to use with CMake to locate TBB
- Clone Cereal into 3rdparty dir
- Save Khronos cl.hpp to 3rdparty dir
- Install an OpenCL SDK (e.g. NVidia CUDA SDK)
- Setup TBB_ROOT_DIR and CUDA_PATH environment variables
- Download standalone catch.hpp into tests dir

## Suggestions

- FindTBB as part of repo
- FindOpenCL as part of repo
- FindCatch2 as part of repo
- Suggest/CMake download CL.hpp
- Move Etaler\3rdparty directory to root dir (helps other projects/exe build and find things like CL.hpp)
- Adopt PR with MSVC changes to code and CMake
